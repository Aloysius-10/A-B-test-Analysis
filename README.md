# Overview
---
DigitalPath Innovations, a leader in digital marketing solutions, seeks to enhance its website's user experience to improve engagement metrics, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction. The company has conducted an A/B test over two weeks, presenting two distinct versions of its webpage (Version A and Version B) to a randomised group of users. This experiment aims to identify which webpage version performs better across various user engagement metrics.

DigitalPath Innovations has compiled a detailed dataset capturing user interactions, behaviours, and responses to each webpage version. This dataset presents a unique opportunity to analyse the effectiveness of each design, inform future design iterations, and ultimately enhance user experience based on data-driven insights.

**Engagement Metrics Analysis**
Assess how each webpage version impacts user engagement, as indicated by time spent on the site, pages viewed, and actions taken.

**Conversaion Rate Optimisation**
Compare the conversion funnel for both versions, analysing metrics from product views to purchase completion. 

**User Feedback Analysis**
Evaluate the correlation between user feedback submission and the webpage version to gauge user engagement/satisfaction.

**Content Interaction**
Investigate the influence of webpage version on content interaction, specifically video watching behaviours.

**Referral Source Impact**
Analyse how different referral sources affect user behaviour and preferences for each webpage version.
